SD1 (n) We can do a mean for answers 1 and 2

For SD2 we can take in account only the column "None" and we can consider the other columns with the same meaning, namely "minority", so we can represent it with a binary variable

SD3

Maybe we can mantain QC1_4

For QC2 we can do the same of SD2, so we can assign 1 if the answer is No ("15), and 0 if teh respondent felt discriminated against in some way

QC3 (?) IDK if it's relevant

For QC4 we might see the most common response for each country and take it as relevant data

For answers to question QC6 we can compute a mean (the more the better)

QC7 

QC8 (is related only to ROMA people, I think is not relevant)

For QC9 we can compute a men (the lesser the better)

QC10 (Trust in istitutions, if I go to an istitutions, then I felt protected

Q11 (mean)

For Q12 we can compute a mean (the more the better) or we can take in account onlu the Q12_10 (I think is better) and Q12_11, Q12_12

We can do the same for qc13

QC15 (compute a mean [the lesser the better])

QC17 (mean)

QC18 (mean)

QC19

QC20
