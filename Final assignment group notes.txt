Giorgio
Aggregate variables by country: 
Sum for each country: people who agree (and donâ€™t) with globalisation, mean salary, 
What is the relationship between these new variables. 

Eric 
Without aggregating: does the country variable affect how many people support transgender people or are the other variables (responses in the questionnaire) more correlated ? 
Looking for relationships between the same answers to questions in one country and another one.  

Alicia

NA 

Next steps: 

Read summary and questionnaire to get familiar with the variables 
Play around with the data in R 

* Select the relevant variables in the questionaire dataset 
    - keep "objective" variables like occupation, city type, etc..
        -> keep age, occupation, nationality, education, income, 
    - also keep some other relevant "subjective" questions related to topic of transgender rights 
        -> find which ones are correlated and get rid of ones that are correlated. 
       Giorgio -> highlight the variables in the questionaire that we will keep 

* Research on which countries have legal rights for transgender people 
    Alicia -> look at legal rights in European countries for same-sex marriage, political history, 
    Eric -> look up economic indices including inequality, edu, crime rates, gender equality index, marriage rates, for eu countries 
    
* Impute missing data and tidy data 
    - Come up with strategy for handling missing data
